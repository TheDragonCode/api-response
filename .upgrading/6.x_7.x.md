## Upgrading To 7.x From 6.x

### PHP 7.2 Required

The new minimum PHP version is now 7.2.

### Updating Dependencies

Update your `andrey-helldar/api-response` dependency to `^7.0` in your `composer.json` file.

### `api_response` function

Changed the order of `api_response` function attributes from:

```php
function api_response(
    $data = null,
    int $status_code = 200,
    array $with = [],
    array $headers = [],
    bool $use_data = true
)
```

to:

```php
function api_response(
    $data = null,
    int $status_code = null, // here
    array $with = [],
    array $headers = []
                            // here
)
```

### Wrapping data

Since the goal of the package is to unify all the answers, we moved the variable definitions into a static function. So, for example, to enable or disable
wrapping content in the `data` key, you need to call the `wrapped` or `withoutWrap` method:

```php
use Helldar\ApiResponse\Services\Response;

Response::wrapped();
// or
Response::withoutWrap();
```

### Extra data

In some cases, when returning answers, you must also give additional data. Such as stack trace, for example.

To prevent this data from getting in response to production, you can globally set a label to show or hide this data:

```php
use Helldar\ApiResponse\Services\Response;

env('APP_DEBUG')
    ? Response::allowWith()
    : Response::withoutWith();
```

### `Helldar\ApiResponse\Services\Response`

An interface with public methods is now available:

```php
namespace Helldar\ApiResponse\Contracts;

use Symfony\Component\HttpFoundation\JsonResponse;

interface Responsable
{
    public static function allowWith(): void;

    public static function withoutWith(): void;

    public static function wrapped(): void;

    public static function withoutWrap(): void;

    public function with(array $with = []): self;

    public function headers(array $headers = []): self;

    public function statusCode(int $code = null): self;

    public function data($data = null): self;

    public function response(): JsonResponse;
}
```

### The `data` method

`data` method from `Helldar\ApiResponse\Services\Response` removed many attributes:

```php
function data($data = null) {}
```

### Laravel & Lumen Frameworks

If you are using Laravel or Lumen framework, update the dependency in the `App\Exceptions\Handler` file depending on your application version and needs:

Replace `use Helldar\ApiResponse\Support\LaravelException as ExceptionHandler;` with:

| Version \ Type | API + WEB | Only API |
|:---:|:---|:---|
| 8.x | `Helldar\ApiResponse\Exceptions\Laravel\Eight\Handler as ExceptionHandler` | `Helldar\ApiResponse\Exceptions\Laravel\Eight\ApiHandler as ExceptionHandler` |
| 7.x | `Helldar\ApiResponse\Exceptions\Laravel\Seven\Handler as ExceptionHandler` | `Helldar\ApiResponse\Exceptions\Laravel\Seven\ApiHandler as ExceptionHandler` |

> Due to the fact that since Laravel 7.x the typing in methods has been changed from Exception to Throwable, we will only support the last two versions of the framework.
>
> BUT this does not prevent you from using the `api_response()` helper yourself anywhere in your application, including your `Handler` file. Our file is just a ready-made example for easy implementation, and no one bothers you to make your own using its analogue.
