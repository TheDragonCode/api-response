## Upgrading To 8.x From 7.x

If you are using the [andrey-helldar/support](https://github.com/andrey-helldar/support) package or dependencies that use it in your project, you need to update
them to support version 2.0.

You can view the list of dependencies using this package with the console command:

```bash
composer why andrey-helldar/support
```

If you do not use this dependency directly or other packages that use it, then you can easily upgrade the `andrey-helldar/api-response` package version to 8.0.
