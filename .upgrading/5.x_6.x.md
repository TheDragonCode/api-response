## Upgrading To 6.x From 5.x

### PHP 7.3 Required

The new minimum PHP version is now 7.3.

### Updating Dependencies

Update your `andrey-helldar/api-response` dependency to `^6.0` in your `composer.json` file.


### `api_response` function

Changed the order of `api_response` function attributes from:

```php
function api_response(
    $data = null,
    int $status_code = 200,
    array $headers = [], // here
    array $with = [],    // here
    bool $use_data = true
)
```

to:

```php
function api_response(
    $data = null,
    int $status_code = 200,
    array $with = [],    // here
    array $headers = [], // here
    bool $use_data = true
)
```

### The `status` method

The `status` method from `Helldar\ApiResponse\Services\Response` has been removed.


### The `data` method

`data` method from `Helldar\ApiResponse\Services\Response` added status code attribute:

```php
function data(
    $data = null,
    int $status_code = 200,
    bool $use_data = true
)
```

### For the Laravel and Lumen Frameworks

    This method works only with the Laravel and Lumen frameworks 7.0 and above.

If you use the Laravel or Lumen framework, you can update the `extends` in the `app\Exceptions\Handler.php` file
to `Helldar\ApiResponse\Support\LaravelException`.

If you did not add anything to this file, then delete everything properties and methods.

As a result, a clean file will look like this:

```php
<?php

namespace App\Exceptions;

use Helldar\ApiResponse\Support\LaravelException as ExceptionHandler;

class Handler extends ExceptionHandler
{
    //
}
```

Or you can change this file by adding code to it, similar to [ours](../src/Support/LaravelException.php).
