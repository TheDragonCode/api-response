  | Register The Composer Auto Loader
  |--------------------------------------------------------------------------
  |
  | Composer provides a convenient, automatically generated class loader
  | for our application. We just need to utilize it! We'll require it
  | into the script here so that we do not have to worry about the
  | loading of any our classes "manually". Feels great to relax.

  | Set The Default Timezone
  |--------------------------------------------------------------------------
  |
  | Here we will set the default timezone for PHP. PHP is notoriously mean
  | if the timezone is not explicitly set. This will be used by each of
  | the PHP date and date-time functions throughout the application.
